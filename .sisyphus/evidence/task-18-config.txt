TASK 18: Update Deployment Configuration Files
================================================

OBJECTIVE:
Remove Convex references and document the new Better Auth + Drizzle stack.

FILES MODIFIED:
===============

1. vercel.json
   - BEFORE: Complex buildCommand with conditional Convex deploy
   - AFTER: Simple buildCommand with NITRO_PRESET=vercel bun run build
   - CHANGE: Removed entire if/else conditional checking VERCEL_ENV
   - VERIFICATION: ✓ No "convex" references in file

2. package.json (scripts section)
   - REMOVED: "convex:dev": "convex dev"
   - REMOVED: "convex:deploy": "convex deploy"
   - ADDED: "db:generate": "drizzle-kit generate"
   - ADDED: "db:migrate": "drizzle-kit migrate"
   - ADDED: "db:push": "drizzle-kit push"
   - ADDED: "db:studio": "drizzle-kit studio"
   - VERIFICATION: ✓ No "convex" references in scripts

3. SETUP.md (complete rewrite)
   - TITLE: Changed from "Setup (Clerk + Convex + Vercel)" to "Setup (Better Auth + Drizzle + Planetscale)"
   - STACK: Updated to Better Auth (self-hosted, cookie-based) + Drizzle ORM + Planetscale Postgres
   - REQUIREMENTS: Removed Convex project access, added Planetscale CLI
   - LOCAL DEV: Simplified to .env.local setup + drizzle-kit commands (no convex dev)
   - REMOVED: All Clerk JWT template setup instructions
   - REMOVED: All Convex deployment instructions
   - REMOVED: All Convex environment variable setup
   - ADDED: Database schema management section (generate, push, studio)
   - ADDED: Authentication setup section (Better Auth configuration)
   - ADDED: Production deploy section (Planetscale branch switching + drizzle-kit push)
   - ENV VARS: Updated to DATABASE_URL + BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (removed CLERK_* and VITE_CONVEX_URL)
   - VERIFICATION: ✓ No "convex" or "clerk" references in file

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
====================

✓ vercel.json: No Convex references
✓ package.json: No Convex scripts
✓ SETUP.md: No Convex or Clerk references
✓ All three files updated successfully
✓ New stack documented: Better Auth + Drizzle + Planetscale
✓ Database scripts added: db:generate, db:migrate, db:push, db:studio
✓ Production deployment instructions updated

STACK MIGRATION SUMMARY:
=======================

OLD STACK:
- Auth: Clerk (managed service)
- Backend: Convex (serverless functions)
- Deployment: Vercel with Convex deploy in buildCommand

NEW STACK:
- Auth: Better Auth (self-hosted, cookie-based)
- Database: Drizzle ORM + Planetscale Postgres
- Deployment: Vercel with simple buildCommand (no Convex)

KEY CHANGES:
- Removed middleware-based auth (Clerk) → Cookie-based sessions (Better Auth)
- Removed serverless functions (Convex) → Server functions + Drizzle ORM
- Removed complex build process → Simple Nitro build
- Removed Clerk JWT setup → Better Auth secret management
- Removed Convex deployment → Drizzle migrations via drizzle-kit

DEPENDENCIES:
=============
This task unblocks Task 19 (build verification).
