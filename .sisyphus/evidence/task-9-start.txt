TASK 9: Rewrite src/start.ts — Remove Clerk Middleware
========================================================

COMPLETION STATUS: ✓ COMPLETE

CHANGES MADE:
- Removed: import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'
- Removed: requestMiddleware: [clerkMiddleware()] from config
- Result: Minimal start.ts with only createStart import and export

FINAL FILE CONTENT:
-------------------
import { createStart } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const startInstance = createStart(() => {
  return {}
})

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✓ No Clerk references in file (grep -i clerk returned no matches)
✓ createStart import present
✓ startInstance export present
✓ File structure matches target specification
✓ TypeScript: Pre-existing config issues unrelated to this change

RATIONALE:
Better Auth handles authentication through its own API route (/api/auth/$),
not through request middleware. Unlike Clerk's middleware-based approach,
Better Auth doesn't require middleware in start.ts.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Unblocks Task 13: __root.tsx rewrite
